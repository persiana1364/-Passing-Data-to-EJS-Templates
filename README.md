# Name Letters - A Simple Name Length App

## Overview

Welcome to **Name Letters**! 🎉 This is a fun and simple web app where users can enter their first and last name, and the app will tell them the total number of characters in their full name. It's a small project to demonstrate the power of **Express**, **EJS**, and **Node.js**.

## Features

* 📝 Users can enter their **first name** and **last name**.
* 📏 The app calculates the total number of characters in the full name.
* 💬 If no name is entered, the app asks the user to provide both names.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js**: For the server-side JavaScript environment.
* **Express.js**: The web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
* **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: To render dynamic HTML with data passed from the server.
* **body-parser**: To parse incoming request bodies.

## Installation

To get this app running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-of-your-project.git
   cd name-of-your-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**:

   Start the server with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Visit the app**:

   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   You'll see a form where you can enter your name!

## How it Works

1. **Enter Your Name**: Type in your first and last name into the input fields and click "OK".
2. **The App Responds**: The app processes your name and calculates the number of characters in your full name.
3. **Results**: The app displays the total number of characters in your full name. If either name field is left empty, you'll be prompted to fill them in.

## Future Improvements

This project is just the beginning! Here are some ideas for future features:

* **Add a character counter** while typing in the name fields.
* **Add a greeting** based on the time of day (Good Morning, Good Evening, etc.).
* **Allow users to submit only their first or last name**, and display a message accordingly.
* **CSS styling** to make the app look more polished and modern.
